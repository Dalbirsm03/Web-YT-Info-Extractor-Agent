#Web_YT_Info_Extractor_Agent

This application uses the **Crew AI Framework** to extract and process information from URLs. Whether the URL points to a **YouTube video** or a **website**, the application uses AI agents to gather relevant insights and summarize the content quickly and efficiently.

The application integrates the **Google Gemini** language model for advanced natural language processing and **Crew AI** for orchestrating the tasks between the research and writing agents.

## Key Features:
- **Support for YouTube Videos and Websites**: The application can process both YouTube video URLs and regular website URLs.
- **AI-Powered Information Extraction**: Uses advanced AI tools to extract and analyze information from video content or website pages.
- **Automated Research and Writing**: Two agents are orchestrated: 
    - **Researcher Agent** extracts the relevant data and insights.
    - **Writer Agent** creates a structured and easy-to-understand summary or article.
- **Customizable Workflow**: The agents work together using the **Crew AI Framework**, which allows for task sequencing and delegation.
